# Project Standards

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Optimize for maintainability and readability
- **Single source of truth** - Types, environment variables, design tokens, and configuration
- **Small and cohesive** - Keep functions, modules, and components focused
- **Fail fast in dev, gracefully in prod** - Loud failures during development, user-friendly errors in production
- **Automate consistency** - Use formatters, linters, codegen, and CI gates

## DOCUMENTATION
- Keep CLI help text concise but informative
- Include examples in README for common use cases
- Document template customization options
- Provide migration guides when updating template structures
- **Living README** - Keep setup, scripts, and architecture overview current
- **Clean code** - Inline docs for complex logic; delete dead code and stale comments

## VERSION CONTROL
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages
- Small, focused pull requests with clear intent
- Require code review before merging
- Semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain CHANGELOG for all releases

## SECURITY
- Store secrets only in secure environment variables; never commit secrets
- Validate all inputs at boundaries
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular dependency updates with security scanning
